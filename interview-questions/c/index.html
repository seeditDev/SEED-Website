</div>

<!-- Question 226 -->
<div class="question">
    <h2>226. What happens if you pass a pointer to a function by value?</h2>
    <p>Passing a pointer by value allows the function to access and modify the object it points to. However, changes made to the pointer itself (like pointing to a new memory address) will not affect the original pointer in the calling function.</p>
</div>

<!-- Question 227 -->
<div class="question">
    <h2>227. What will be the output of the following code?</h2>
    <pre>int a = 5;
    int *ptr = &a;
    printf("%d", *ptr++);</pre>
    <p>The output will be <code>5</code> because the post-increment operator increments the pointer after dereferencing, so the value 5 is printed before the pointer moves.</p>
</div>

<!-- Question 228 -->
<div class="question">
    <h2>228. What happens if you use an uninitialized pointer in C?</h2>
    <p>Using an uninitialized pointer leads to undefined behavior, and the result may vary depending on the memory address the pointer contains. It may cause crashes or corrupt data.</p>
